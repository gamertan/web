# Changelog

## v0.1.0-preview.1 — 2026-08-16

- Establish independent request metadata, logging, browser security, abuse,
  authentication, SQLite, and analytics package boundaries.
- Add a minimal 0BSD `net/http` starter.
- Fail closed when unsafe requests lack same-origin evidence or authentication
  middleware is constructed with invalid cookie/service configuration.
- Bound untrusted request-record byte and duration fields before aggregation.
- Support Linux as the maintained release platform; native Windows is not a
  release gate or compatibility promise.

No compatibility promise is made before a stable release.
